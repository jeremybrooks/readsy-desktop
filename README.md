-------------


REQUIREMENTS
------------
Scrip du Jour requires Java 1.6 or higher.  You can get it from http://java.sun.com.


INSTALLING SCRIP DU JOUR
------------------------
There are several ways to install Scrip du Jour, depending on your operating system of choice and how easy you want it to be.

For Windows and Linux operating systems, it is recommended that you use the graphical installer.  It is named ScripDuJour-x.x.x_Installer.jar.  Download and double click it, or run java -jar ScripDuJour-x.x.x_Installer.jar to launch the installation program.  Just click through it, and you should be ready to go.

For Mac OSX, it is recommended that you download ScripDuJour-x.x.x.dmg.  Double click the disk image to mount it, and drag ScripDuJour to your Applications folder.

If you are a command-line junkie, you can download either ScripDuJour-x.x.x_ANY.tar.gz or ScripDuJour-x.x.x_ANY.zip.  There are some scripts included that will launch the application.  Depending on your environment, you may need to adjust the scripts slightly.  But you are a command-line junkie, so you like doing that sort of thing, right?


RUNNING SCRIP DU JOUR
---------------------
Windows/Linux: The graphical installer should have created a menu item for you, and optionally shortcuts on your Desktop.   Launch the program using either the menu items or the desktop shortcuts.

Mac: Double click the Scrip du Jour application icon.

Command Line:  If you installed from the command line, use the script sdj.sh (*nix) or sdj.bat (Windows) to start Scrip du Jour.  The script must be executed from the bin directory.

The first time you run the program, it will create some necessary directories and files, and display a message asking you to install some data files.  Use the Tools -> Install Data Files menu to locate the files on your hard drive and install them in the program data directory. You can make your own data files, or contact jeremyb@whirljack.net for some commonly requested data files.

You can delete data files when they are no longer needed by using the Tools -> Delete Data Files menu.  If you delete a data file, you will lose the information associated with that file.  This means that all the days you marked as "Read" will no longer be marked as read.


UNINSTALLING SCRIP DU JOUR
--------------------------
If you used the graphical installer, it should have created an Uninstaller for you.  After running the uninstaller, you can get rid of any data files you installed by deleting the directory .scripdujour (note the beginning . in the filename) located in your home directory.

If you are using a Mac, just drag the application icon to the trash.  You can get rid of any data files you installed by deleting the directory .scripdujour (note the beginning . in the filename) located in your home directory.

If you installed the command-line junkie way, just delete the directory created when you unpacked the archive.  You can get rid of any data files you installed by deleting the directory .scripdujour (note the beginning . in the filename) located in your home directory.


CREATING DATA FILES
-------------------
An editor is included with Scrip du Jour to make it easy to create your own data files, and edit existing data files.  You can start the editor from the Tools menu.  

When you launch the editor, you will be prompted to create a new file, or open an existing file.  If you create a new file, an skeleton file will be created, with empty entries for each day.

Once you have created a new file or opened an existing file, you will be taken to a window that shows the data and can be edited.  Make whatever changes you want.  You can navigate using the buttons.  Your changes are automatically saved whenever you move to a new day, or when you exit the window.
