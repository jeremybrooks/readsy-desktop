helpTextArea.text=readsy is a program that helps you read something every day. You can use it to keep up with all sorts of reading, and you can create your own readsy files to suit your needs.\n\nTo check for updates automatically, check the "Check for Updates At Startup" box.  This will connect to the readsy home page, and see if there is a newer version.  No information is sent from your computer during this check.\n\nSetting the default font size will change the size of the heading and text.\n\nYou can use Dropbox to sync your reading. This allows you to store your reading in the cloud so that you can keep up with your reading on any device that can run readsy.\n\nIf you need help, or have suggestions, you can email jeremyb@whirljack.net.
